# simple-world-borders
If you are experiencing lag on your realm, or just want to decrease the exploration size, I've provided some free, super simple only-purpose behavior packs for a world border.

Features:
> - Doesn't conflict with any other addon.
> - Easy apply & instantly working.
> - Will not break in future Minecraft updates.
> - Instantly teleports players back.
> - Warns players they've reached the border.
> - No back door & no obfuscation, created by ARAS Staff (me).
> - Add tag "admin" to bypass the border.
